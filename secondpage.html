           663 Million People in the World Live Without Clean Water.</h2>
      <p> <span>That’s nearly 1 in 10 people worldwide. Or, twice the population of the United States. The majority live in isolated rural areas and spend hours every day walking to collect water for their family. Not only does walking for water keep children out of school or take up time that parents could be using to earn money, but the water often carries diseases that can make everyone sick.
But access to clean water means education, income and health - especially for women and kids.</span>

    <h2 id= "break">Clean Water Changes Everything.</h2>
    <p> <h3>HEALTH</h3></p>
<p>
Diseases from dirty water kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war.</p>

<p id="ital"> 43% of those deaths are children under five years old. Access to clean water and basic sanitation can save around 16,000 lives every week.</p>

<p> <h3>EDUCATION</h3></p>
<p>
Clean water helps keep kids in school, especially girls.</p>

<p id="ital"> Less time collecting water means more time in class. Clean water and proper toilets at school means teenage girls don’t have to stay home for a week out of every month.</p>

          <p> <h3 id= "break2">TIME</h3></p>
          <p>
          Access to clean water gives communities more time to grow food, earn an income, and go to school -- all of which fight poverty.</p>

          <p> <h3>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h3></p>
          <p>
          Women are responsible for 72% of the water collected in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
